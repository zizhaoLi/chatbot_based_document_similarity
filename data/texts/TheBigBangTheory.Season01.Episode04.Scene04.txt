Morning Morning . You're making eggs for breakfast ? This isn't breakfast , it's an experiment . Huh ? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast . I finally have the time to test my hypothesis , about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins , and its impact vis-a-vis taste . Sounds yummy . I look forward to your work with bacon . As do I. You know , I'm sure if you just apologized to Gablehauser he would give you your job back . I don't want my job back . I've spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations . Before that I spent four years working on my thesis . Before that I was in college , and before that , I was in the fifth grade . This is my first day off in decades , and I'm going to savour it . Okay . I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs . I'm not just fixing my eggs , I'm fixing everyone's eggs . And we all thank you . Use new eggs . Hi , hey . I'm running out to the market , do you guys need anything ? Oh , well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence . I'm sorry ? I need eggs . Four dozen should suffice . Four dozen ? Yes , and evenly distributed amongst brown , white , free range , large , extra-large and jumbo . Okay , one more time ? Never mind , you won't get it right , I'd better come with you . Oh , yay !
