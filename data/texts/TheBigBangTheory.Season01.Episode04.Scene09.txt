Thank you for coming on such short notice . You did the right thing calling . I didn't know what else to do , he's lost all focus , every day he's got a new obsession . This is a particularly disturbing one . Mommy . Hi baby . You called my mother ? Oh , you got yourself a loom , how nice . Thank you . Honey , why did you get a loom ? I was working with luminous fish , and I thought , hey , loom ! Mom , what are you doing here ? Leonard called me . I know , but why ? Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes . This is not a sarape . This is a poncho . A sarape is open at the sides , a poncho is closed , this is a poncho , and neither is a reason to call someone's mother . Really , when was the last time you left the house . I went to the market with Penny . That was three weeks ago . Well then buckle up , in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby . Sweetheart , your little friend is concerned about you . Yes , well I'm not a child , I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit . And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother . Where are you going ? To my room , and no-one's allowed in . He gets his temper from his daddy . Oh . He's got my eyes . I see . All that science stuff , that comes from Jesus .
