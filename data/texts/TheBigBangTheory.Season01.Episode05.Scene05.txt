Big boy ! Someone touched my board . Oh God , my board . Leonard ! Leonard ! Hey , what's the matter ? My equations , someone's tampered with my equations . Are you sure ? Of course I'm sure . Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics , the sign's been changed . Oh yeah . But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having ? Are you insane ? Are you out of your mind ? Are you ... . hey look , that fixes the problem I've been having . You're welcome . You did this ? Yeah , I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water , so I fixed it , now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies . Pretty cool , huh ? Cool ? Listen , I got to hit the lab . Thanks for a great night . Thank you , I'll see you at work . Uh-duh , hold on , hold on ! What ? Who told you you could touch my board ? No-one . I don't come into your house and touch your board . There are no incorrect equations on my board . Oh , that is so ... so ... I'm sorry , I've got to run , if you come up with an adjective , text me . . Inconsiderate , that is the adjective , inconsiderate .
