Okay , nice and cosy , okay , I'll see you later . Wait . Will you please rub this on my chest . Oh , Sheldon , can't you do that yourself ? Vaporub makes my hands smell funny . But Sheldon ... . Please , please , please , please , please , please , please . I can't believe I'm doing this . No , no , counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats . Sorry . Can you sing " Soft Kitty " . What ? My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick . I'm sorry , honey , I don't know it . I'll teach you . " Soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur , happy kitty , sleepy kitty , purr purr purr . " Now you . Soft kitty , warm kitty ... Little ball of fur . Keep rubbing . Little ball of fur .
