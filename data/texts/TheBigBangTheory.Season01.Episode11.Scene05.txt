Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen . No , just crazy . Sheldon , what are you doing here ? I'm sick , thank you very much . How could you have gotten it from me , I'm not sick . You're a carrier . All these people here are doomed . You're doomed ! Shhh ! Sheldon , what do you want . I want soup . Why didn't you just ... . Why didn't you just have soup at home . Penny , I have an IQ of 187 , don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it ? You can have soup delivered . I did not think of that . Clearly febrile delirium is setting in , please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for . Okay , what kind of soup do you want . Well , my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons . We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek . Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons ? No . Then surprise me . Would you call that moss green or forest green ?
