You can stare at your board all day Sheldon , she's still going to be right . I'm not staring , I'm mulling . Oh , hey Leonard . Oh , hi . So , how's it going ? Pretty good . Just pretty good , I'd think you were doing very good . Pretty , very , there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good , why do you ask ? Well , a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night . Sheldon ! I'm coming . So , is it serious , do you like her ? Wuh , I don't ... . th-th-th-that's really two different questions , uh , I'm not ... . Sheldon , we have to go ! Boy , you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse . Alright , well , I'll talk to you later , but , I am so happy for you Leonard . Thank you . What did she mean , she's happy for me ? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone , or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy , because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy , even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy . You know , because the second person , though happy , is now romantically unavailable to the first person . Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call ? You know what , I'm being ridiculous . But who cares what Penny thinks , Lesley is a terrific girl , she's attractive , we like each other , she's extremely intelligent . She's not that intelligent . She fixed your equation . She got lucky . You don't believe in luck . I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky . Regardless , I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley , I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy . Leonard ? Yeah . I still don't care .
