What's that ? Tea . When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages . There there . You want to talk about it ? No . Good . There there was really all I had . Good night Sheldon . Good night Leonard . Hey Leonard . Hi Penny . Hey , I just wanted to make sure you're okay . I'm fine . I'm so sorry about what happened . It's not your fault . Yes it is . That's why I broke up with him , he always does stuff like that . So why was he at your party ? Well , I ran into him last week and , he was ... just , all apologetic , about how he's changed , he was just going on and on and I believed him , and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and ... I can't go back to my party because he's there , and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to ... There there . God , what is wrong with me . Nothing , you're perfect . Gah , I'm not perfect . Yes you are . You really think so , don't you ? Penny ? Yeah . How much have you had to drink tonight ? Just ... . a lot . Are you sure that your being drunk , and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here ? It might . Boy , you're really smart . Yeah , I'm a frickin' genius . Leonard , you are so great . Why can't all guys be like you ? Because if all guys were like me , the human race couldn't survive . I should probably go . Probably . Thank you . That's right , you saw what you saw . That's how we roll in The Shire .
