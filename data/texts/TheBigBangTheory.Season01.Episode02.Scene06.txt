Sheldon ! Sssshhhh ! Penny's sleeping . Are you insane , you can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean . I had no choice . I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room , and just outside our living room was that hallway , and immediately adjacent to that hallway was ... this . Do you realize that if Penny wakes up , there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here ? I just gave you a reasonable explanation . No , no . You gave me an explanation , it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers . Don't be ridiculous . I have no peers . Sheldon , we have to get out of here . You might want to speak in a lower register . What ? Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep , so that they'll be roused by a crying baby . If you want to avoid waking her , speak in a lower register . That's ridiculous . No , that's ridiculous . align= " left " | Fine . I accept your premise , now please let's go . I am not leaving until I'm done . O-o-o-oh ! If you have time to lean , you have time to clean . Oh , what the hell .
