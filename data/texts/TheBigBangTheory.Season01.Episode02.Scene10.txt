Hi . Oh . What's going on ? Um , here's the thing . Penny . Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb , so too I regret my participation in what was , at the very least , an error in judgment . The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes . Some mistakes , such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow , painful death from radiation poisoning . Another example , from the field of ebola research ... . Leonard . Yeah . We're okay .
