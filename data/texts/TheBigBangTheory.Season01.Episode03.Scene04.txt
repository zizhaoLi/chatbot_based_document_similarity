Sheldon , if you were a robot , and I knew and you didn't , would you want me to tell you ? That depends . When I learn that I'm a robot , will I be able to handle it ? Maybe , although the history of science-fiction is not on your side . Uh , let me ask you this . When I learn that I'm a robot , would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics ? You might be bound by them right now . That's true . Have you ever harmed a human being , or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm ? Of course not . Have you ever harmed yourself , or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered ? Well , no . I smell robot . Hey , what's going on . The internet's been down for half an hour . Also , Sheldon may be a robot . So , how did it go with Lesley ? Oh , we tried kissing , but the earth didn't move . I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway . Oh , I've seen that look before . This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs , and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats . I don't know if I can take it . You could power down . Well , as usual , Wolowitz has the solution . I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women , and Leonard could have his pick .
