Hey , Lesley . Careful Leonard , liquid nitrogen , 320 degrees below zero . Brrrr . Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana . Because I've got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife . So anyway Hello . Uh , what are you doing ? Just extending the intimacy . Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower ? Okay , uh , what exactly do you think's going on between us ? I'm not sure , but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt . Listen , Leonard , neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex , I mean , dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure . You stick electrodes in a rat's brain , give him an orgasm button , he'll push that thing until he starves to death . Who wouldn't ? Well , the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus . That's where you come in . Yeah , well , I'm just glad to be a part of it . So what happens now ? Well , I don't know about your sex drive , but I'm probably good till New Years . Oh . Okay . Thank you . Thank you ! You want to make plans for New Years . Woah , Leonard , please , you're smothering me . Sorry . Hey , look , it's Doctor Stud ! Doctor what ? The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music . Wha ... how did it get on the internet ? I put it there . Well , how did you know about it ? A little bird told us . Apparently you are a magnificent beast . Well , that part's true !
