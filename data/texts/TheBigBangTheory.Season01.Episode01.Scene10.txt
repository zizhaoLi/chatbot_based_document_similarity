Sheldon , I'm so sorry I dragged you through this . It's okay . It wasn't my first pantsing , and it won't be my last . And you were right about my motives , I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex . Well you got me out of my pants . Anyway , I've learned my lesson . She's out of my league , I'm done with her , I've got my work , one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone . Don't think like that , you're not going to die alone . Thank you Sheldon , you're a good friend . And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize .
