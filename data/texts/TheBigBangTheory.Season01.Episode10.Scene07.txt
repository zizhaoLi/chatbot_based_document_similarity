Leonard , Leonard , Leonard ... Let it go , Sheldon , the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not . No , that's the least of our worries . I've been doing some research on addiction , both the biochemical and behavioral aspects , and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie . What are you talking about , it's fine , she bought it , it's over . Sadly , it's not . Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle , but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab . Why not ? Because Leo is a middle child . There is no Leo , how can you say that ? You didn't read the bio , did you ? He's not just a middle child , he's the quintessential middle child , from a broken home to boot . Psychologically speaking , the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab . I've got a solution . Great , what is it ? Get out . Fine . I've hesitated to point this out , but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit . I'm just trying to clean up after your mess . We'll talk in the morning .
