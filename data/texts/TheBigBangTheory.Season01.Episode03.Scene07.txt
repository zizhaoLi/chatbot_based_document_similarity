Ah , hey Leonard . Good afternoon Penny , so hi , hey . Uh ... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner . Uh , do you mean dinner tonight ? There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner . Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed , so , to clarify here , by dinner I mean supper . Supper ? Or dinner . I was thinking six thirty , if you can go , or a different time . Uh , six thirty's great . Really ? Great ! Yeah , I like hanging out with you guys . Us guys ? You know , Sheldon , Howard , Raj , who all's coming ? They ... . might all be there . Or a subset of them might be there , uh , algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns , for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch , sometimes he finds that filling , other times he doesn't , it's no fault of Quizznos , they have a varied menu . Okay , whatever , it sounds like fun . Great . Did we say a time ? Six thirty . And that's still good for you . It's fine . Cos it's not carved in stone . No , six thirty's great . I'll get my chisel . Why ? To ... carve the ... okay , I'll see you six thirty .
