What the hell are you doing ? I'm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures . With lime jello ? I need a growth medium , and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt . Here , swab my throat . I don't think so . Leonard ! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat . Sheldon , you are not sick . This is , but you are not . We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment . And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies . Sheldon , don't you think you're overreacting ? When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me , these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance . I'm going back to bed . Wait . Put this in the bathroom . What for ? I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down . I mix pancake batter in this ! No , that measuring cup has always been for urine . You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment , including the label maker , but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup ? It's right here on the bottom . Huh . I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology .
