Good morning , snicker-doodle . Morning . Oh , well that looks awful fancy , what is that ? It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form . But intelligently designed by a creator , right ? What do you want , mom ? You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water ? Yeah . Well , I'm done fishing . You put those on . What for ? Because you're going to go down to your office , you're going to apologize to your boss , and get your job back . No . I'm sorry , did I start that sentence with the words " if it please your highness? " I'm not going to apologize , I didn't say anything that wasn't true . Now you listen here , I have been telling you since you were four years old , it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out . Why not ? Because people don't like it . Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbor kids ? Now let's get cracking . Shower , shirt , shoes , and let's shove off . Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked .
