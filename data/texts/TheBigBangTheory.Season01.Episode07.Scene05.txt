Oh , hey guys , what's up ? It's Halo night . Yeah . Okay . So ? Well , with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christy , She's not my friend . Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty . Right , anyway , uh , with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere , we had something we wanted to ask you . Sheldon ? Yes . Penny , we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team . I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is . Oh , that's so sweet . But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend . You can't go out , it's Halo night . Well , for Penny it's dancing night . You go dancing every Wednesday ? No . Then it's not dancing night . Look , why don't I play with you guys tomorrow ? Tonight is Halo night ! It's like talking to a wall . Alright , now Sheldon , you and I are about to have a problem . Sheldon , remember , we role-played this . Yes , but you didn't portray her as completely irrational . Alright fellas , I gotta go . Good luck . Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend . Okay , assuming we could dance , which we can't , there are three of us and two of them . So ? It's the Chinese restaurant all over again . I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men , each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman . Aaah , for God's sake , Sheldon , you are driving me crazy . Your anger's not with me , sir , but with basic mathematics . No , I'm pretty sure my anger's with you . What's happening to us ? We're falling apart . Who are you calling ? The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe . Hi this is Howard Wolowitz . And this is Christy Van Der Bell . We can't get to the phone right now because we're having sex ! You're not going to put that on your message are you ? No , I'm just kidding , I'll re-record it .
