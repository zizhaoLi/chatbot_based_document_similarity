It's a small brown paper bag , Ma , I'm looking at it right now . Why would I make that up , there's no ding-dong in it . How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today ? So , this is engineering , huh ? I'll talk to you later . Engineering . Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream . Hello , oompah-loompahs of science . Sheldon , what are you doing here ? I just came by to say hello . I've been at this lab for three years , you've never came by to say hello . Well , up until now I've had better things to do . So , what are we making today ? A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle . Really , how does it work ? When this is done , it will be attached to the payload bay , and the sensor apparatus will rest on it . Uh , huh . So it's a shelf ? No , you don't understand , during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide ... yeah , okay , it's a shelf . Now , I notice you're using titanium , did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes , they're lighter , cheaper and half twice the tensile strength . Sheldon , there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering . And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you , bubbula . But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes . Sheldon . Yes . Go away . Did Leonard tell you to say that ? No , I thought of it all by myself . Huh . It can't be a coincidence . There must be some causal link I'm missing .
