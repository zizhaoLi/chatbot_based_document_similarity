This is great . Look at me , out in the real world of ordinary people , just living their ordinary , colourless , workaday lives . Thank you . No , thank you . And thank you , ordinary person . Hey , you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes . Uh , no , no not really . Listen , didn't you say you needed some eggs . Uh , yes , but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket . Oh , okay , well maybe you should start heading on out then . No , this is fun . Oh , the thing about tomatoes , and I think you'll really enjoy this , is , they're shelved with the vegetables , but they're technically a fruit . Interesting . Isn't it ? No , I mean what you find enjoyable . Oh boy . What now ? Well , there's some value to taking a multivitamin , but the human body can only absorb so much , what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine . Well , maybe that's what I was going for . Well then you'll want some manganese .
