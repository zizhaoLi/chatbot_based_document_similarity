Howard , it's the phone . I know it's the phone , Ma , I hear the phone . Well who's calling at this ungodly hour ? I don't know . Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour . How can I ask them when I'm talking to you ! Hello . Howard , it's Leonard , code Milky Green . Dear Lord , not Milky Green ! Affirmative , with fever . Who's on the phone . It's Leonard . Why is he calling . Sheldon's sick . Were you playing with him ? For God's sake , Ma , I'm twenty six years old . Excuse me Mr Grown-up . Whadda-ya want for breakfast . Chocolate milk and eggoes please ! Howard , listen to me . Hang on , call waiting . No , don't , don't ... . Hello . Howard , I'm sick . Howard's sleeping , this is his mother . Why are you calling at this ungodly hour ? I need soup . Then call your own mother . It was Sheldon . I tried to stop you . It's my own fault , I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of '06 . You call Koothrappali , we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours . Stand by . Ma , can my friends come over ? I just had the carpets steamed . That's a negatory . But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today . Five movies , two hours apiece . It's a start .
