Okay , the X10s are online . Gentlemen , I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP , racing down fiber-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco , bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon , Portugal , where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax , Nova-Scotia , and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this lamp . . Look at me , look at me , I've got goosebumps . Are we ready on the stereo ? Go for stereo . Hey guys . Hello . It's a little loud . No problem , turning it down . San Francisco , Lisbon , Halifax et voila . Okay , thanks . Hang on , hang on , do you not realize what we just did . Yeah , you turned your stereo down with your laptop . No , we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet . Oh . You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack , they're really cheap . No , no , no , you don't get it , um , Howard , enable public access . Public access enabled . Boy , that's brilliant , but I'll see you . No , hang on , hang on . See ! No . Someone in Sezchuan province , China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off . Huh , well that's handy . Um , here's a question , why ? Because we can . They found the remote controlled cars . Well , wait , wait , what's on top of them . Wireless webcams , wave hello . The monster truck is out of Austin , Texas , and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv . You may want to put on slacks . What ? Ew , stop it , no , leave me alone . Who's running the red Corvette ? That would be me .
