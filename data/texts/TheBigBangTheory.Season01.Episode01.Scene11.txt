This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest , they have a great house ale . Wow , cool tiger . Yeah , I've had him since level ten . His name is Buttons . Anyway , if you had your own game character we could hang out , maybe go on a quest . Uh , sounds interesting . So you'll think about it ? Oh , I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it . Smooth . We're home . Oh , my God , what happened ? Well , your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory . I'm so sorry , I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass . No , it was a valid hypothesis . That was a valid hypothesis ? What is happening to you ? Really , thank you so much for going and trying you're , uh , you're so terrific . Why don't you put some clothes on , I'll get my purse and dinner is on me , okay ? Really ? Great . Thank you . You're not done with her , are you ? Our babies will be smart and beautiful . Not to mention imaginary .
