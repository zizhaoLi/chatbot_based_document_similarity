Oh , dear God . Leonard ! Leonard , I'm sick ! Leonard ! Leonard I'm sick ! Leonard ! Leonard ! Leonard . Leonard , my comforter fell down , and my sinuses hurt when I bend over . Leonard ? Ow ! Hey . Leonard , where are you ? I'm at work . At six-thirty in the morning ? Yes . On Sunday ? Yes . Why ? They asked me to come in . Well , I didn't hear the phone ring . They texted me . Well , as I predicted , I am sick . My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am , and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate . No kidding ? No . Not only that , it has shifted from clear to milky green . Alright , well , get some rest and drink plenty of fluids . What else would I drink ? Gasses ? Solids ? Ionised plasma ? Drink whatever you want . I want soup . Then make soup . We don't have soup . I'm at work , Sheldon . Is that a dog ? Yes , In the lab ? Yes , they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists , I have to go .
