Hey Raj . Hey , listen , I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon , but I'm really upset about it , I mean they just , they let themselves into my place , and then they cleaned it , I mean can you even believe that ? How weird is that ? Ooh , she's standing very close to me . Oh my , she does smell good . What is that , vanilla ? You know , where I come from , someone comes into your house at night , you shoot , okay ? And you don't shoot to wound . I mean , alright , my sister shot her husband , but it was an accident , they were drunk . What was I saying ? She's so chatty . Maybe my parents are right . Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl . We'd have the same cultural background , and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me . It's obvious that they meant well , but I'm just , I'm having a really rough time , like I said , I broke up with my boyfriend , and it's just freaking me out . I mean , just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks , doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are . Right ? She asked me a question . I should probably nod . That's exactly what I thought . Thank you for listening . You're a doll . Oh-oh . Turn your pelvis .
