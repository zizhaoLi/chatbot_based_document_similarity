Oh , hey Sheldon , what's going on ? I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics . I'm sorry ? Semiotics , the study of signs and symbols &ndash ; it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics . Okay , sweetie , I know you think you're explaining yourself , but you're really not . Just come with me . Well ? Well what ? What does it mean ? Oh , come on , you went to college . Yes , but I was eleven . Alright , look , a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're , you know , getting busy . So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there . Well , either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams . Oh Leonard , you magnificent beast . We really shouldn't be standing here . This is very awkward . Oh , come on , you know , Leonard's had girls over before , right ? Oh , yes , but there's usually planning , courtship and advance notice . Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse . Wait , you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex ? I didn't have to , the dates just happened to coincide . So , do you know who's in there ? Well , there's Leonard . And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster . Hmmm . Good for him . Good for Leonard . Okay , night . No , no , wait , hold on . What's the matter ? I don't know what the protocol is here . Do I stay , do I leave ? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage ? Gee , Sheldon , you're asking the wrong girl . I'm usually on the other side of the tie . Hi , Leonard . It's me , Sheldon . In the living room . I just , I wanted you to know I saw the tie . Message received . You're welcome . You carry on . Give my best to Lesley .
