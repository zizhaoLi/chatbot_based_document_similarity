Watch your fingers . Watch your fingers . Oh God , my fingers ! You okay ? No , it hurt ... Great Caesar's Ghost , look at this place ? So Penny's a little messy . A little messy ? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy , this is chaos . Excuse me , explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid . I'm just inferring that this is a couch , because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale . Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort , organize and label the entire world around them ? No . Well they don't . Hard as it may be for you to believe , most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content . Excuse me , but I think we've both found that helpful at times . Come on , we should go . Hang on . What are you doing ? Straightening up . Sheldon , this is not your home . This is not anyone's home , this is a swirling vortex of entropy . When the transvestite lived here , you didn't care how he kept the place . Because it was immaculate , I mean , you open that man's closet , it was left to right , evening gowns , cocktail dresses , then his police uniforms . What were you doing in his closet ? I helped run some cable for a webcam . Hey guys . Oh , hey Penny , this just arrived , we just brought this up , just now . Great . Was it hard getting it up the stairs ? No . No ? No . No . Well , we'll get out of your hair . Oh , great , thank you again Penny , I just want you to know that , you don't have to live like this . I'm here for you . What's he talking about ? It's a joke . I don't get it . Yeah , he didn't tell it right .
