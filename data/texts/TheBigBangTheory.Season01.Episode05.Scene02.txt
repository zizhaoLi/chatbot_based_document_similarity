What did Penny mean , you'd make a cute couple ? Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute . An alternate , and somewhat less likely interpretation , is that you could manufacture one . As in , oh look , Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb , aren't they adorable . If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she , Penny , thought that I should her , Lesley , out , indicating that she , Penny , had no interest in me asking her , Penny , out . But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she , Lesley , had turned me down then she , Penny , could be offering consolation . That's too bad , you would have made a cute couple . But while thinking , good , Leonard remains available . You're a lucky man , Leonard . How so ? You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought . Well , what do you think . I said I could follow it , I didn't say I cared .
