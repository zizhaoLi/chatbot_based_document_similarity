Penny , Penny , Penny , Good morning . Do you have any idea what time it is ? Of course I do . My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder , Colorado . It's accurate to one tenth of a second . But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical . What do you want ? Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium ? I remember symposium . Yes , well , he lied . Wait , what ? He lied , and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it . Well imagine how I'm feeling . Hungry ? Tired ? I'm sorry this really isn't my strong suit .
