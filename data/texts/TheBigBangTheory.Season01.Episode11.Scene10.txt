What do you see , what do you see . The living room appears to be empty . Okay , he must be in his bedroom . My spare glasses are in my bedroom , on my dresser , next to my Bat-signal . I'm not going in there . Raj ? No way , Jose . Well I can't do it , I can't see anything . It's all right , wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset . We'll be your eyes . Fine . One more thing . This is a subsonic impact sensor . If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk , this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop . At that point , based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon , you'll have seven seconds to get out , glasses or no glasses . Won't my footsteps set it off ? No , you'll be on your hands and knees . Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room . Well , how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees ? Stay low . Bear left . Now keep true . What ? It means go straight . Then just say go straight . You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings , you say keep true . Alright I just hit my head . Because you didn't keep true . Okay , turn right . The ... the picture's breaking up . Angle your head to the right . A little more . A little more . That's it , now just keep true . Alright , you're close enough to Sheldon's room , deploy the sensor . Now turn it on . It wasn't on ? No . Then why did I have to crawl ? Oh , I guess you didn't . Okay , it's on . Good . From this point forward you will have to crawl . I know . Hang on , the sensor's picking up something , turn your head back . You rat bastard . Told you the sensor would work . Hi ! You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon . Well , I had to , you see what he's like . Penny ! Penny , I'm hungry . Uh , it's okay , sweetie , good news , Leonard's home ! No ! Here you go , good luck , bye . W-wait ! Leonard , I'm hungry ! Wait ! Penny ! Take me with you ! I want grilled cheese . Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us ? I don't think Penny's ever coming here again . I'm very congested . Yeah , so ? Can you go to the kitchen , and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus . If I stand , I'll vomit . Under the sink , yellow Tupperware bowl .
