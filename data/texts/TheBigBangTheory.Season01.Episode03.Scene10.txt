Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room ? No , no , I'm okay , it's stopped bleeding . I know , but you did throw up . Isn't that a sign of a concussion ? Yes , but I get car sick too , so ... Okay . Sorry about your car , by the way . Oh , no , it's fine , you got most of it out the window . The poor guy on the bike . I had a nice time . Yeah , me too . Um , good night . Leonard ? Yeah . Was this supposed to be a date ? This ? No . No , of course not , this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up , because of work and a colonoscopy . Okay , I was just checking . When I take a girl out on a date , and I do , she knows she's been dated . Capital D. Bold face , underline , like Day-ted . I think I might have a little concussion , I'm going to go lay down for a while , good night .
