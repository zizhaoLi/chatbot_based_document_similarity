Hello Lesley . Hi Leonard . Lesley I would like to propose an experiment . Goggles , Leonard . Right . Lesley , I would like to propose an experiment . Hang on . I'm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o' noodles . Pfff , I've done it , about two seconds , 2.6 for minestrone . Anyway , I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay . Wait , are you asking me out ? I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm , with the addition of a date-like component . But we don't need to quibble over terminology . What sort of experiment would you propose ? There is a generally accepted pattern in this area , I would pick you up , take you to a restaurant , then we would see a movie , probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock . Interesting . And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss . Heartrate , pheromones , etc , yes . Well , why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable . You mean , kiss you now ? Yes . Can you define the parameters of the kiss ? Closed mouth but romantic . Mint ? Thank you . . Shall I count down from three ? No , I think it needs to be spontaneous . What do you think . You proposed the experiment , I think you should present your findings first . Fair enough . On the plus side , it was a good kiss , reasonable technique , no extraneous spittle . On the other hand , no arousal . None ? None . Ah . Well , thank you for your time . Thank you . None at all ?
