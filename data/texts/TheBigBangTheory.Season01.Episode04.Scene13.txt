Excuse me , Dr Gablehouser , are you busy ? Well , actually ... . Sheldon , he's just doodling , get in here . Dr Gablehouser . Dr Cooper . Let's go , baby , we're losing daylight . Um , as you know , several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot , when I called you an idiot . And I just wanted to say that I was wrong . To point it out . I'm sorry , we haven't been introduced . Dr Eric Gablehouser . Mary Cooper , Sheldon's mom . Now that's impossible , you must have had him when you were a teenager . Oh , aren't you sweet , his father's dead . Recently ? Long enough . Please . Sheldon , shouldn't you be working ? Okay . Hey , how did it go ? I got my job back . Really ? What happened ? I'm not quite sure . It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me . That narrows it down .
