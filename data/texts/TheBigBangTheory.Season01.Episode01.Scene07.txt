I'll do the talking . Yeah . Hi , I'm Leonard , this is Sheldon . Hello . What did I just ... . Uh , we're here to pick up Penny's TV . Get lost . Okay , thanks for your time . We're not going to give up just like that . Leonard , the TV is in the building , we've been denied access to the building , ergo we are done . Excuse me , if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang . My apologies . What's your plan . It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work . Come on , we have a combined IQ of 360 , we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building . What do you think their combined IQ is ? Just grab the door .
