Checkmate . O-o-o-o-h ! Again ? Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess , perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed . Just reset the board . It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels . Hi guys . Hey ! Did you get my mail . Yeah , right here . How was Nebraska ? Oh , better than North Dakota ! I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska . From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion . All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here . Boy , it's good to be back . How was your family ? Ugh , it was the worst trip , everyone got sick over the weekend . Sick ? Here we go . What kind of sick ? Oh , the flu I guess . I don't need you to guess , I need you to know , now when did the symptoms first appear ? Maybe Friday . Friday , was that morning or afternoon ? I ... I don't ... Think woman , who blew their nose and when ? Sheldon , relax , she doesn't have any symptoms , I'm sure she's not contagious . Oh please , if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago . Somewhere between tool using and cave painting , homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose . Penny , you'll have to excuse Sheldon , he's a bit of a germophobe . Oh , it's okay , I understand . Thanks for your consideration , now please leave . You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol . Okay , well , thank you for getting my mail . No problem . Welcome home . What ?
