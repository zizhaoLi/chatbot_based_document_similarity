I admire your fingering . Thank you . Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument . Goodnight guys , good job . Thanks . See you next week . That was fun , Lesley , thanks for including me . You're welcome . If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again . Uh , sure , why not . Just so we're clear , you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available . Really ? Yeah , I'm good to go . I thought you weren't interested in me . That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs . You mean my cello ? No , I mean the obvious crude double entendre . I'm seducing you . No kidding ? What can I say , I'm a passionate and impulsive woman . So how about it ? Gee , uh ... Is it the waitress ? Penny ? What about her ? Well , I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her , which , unless you're a heroin addict , points to sexual attraction . Well , I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast , which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils , so I guess there's no point in bringing it up . You and the waitress then ? No . No , there's nothing going on between Penny and me . So , you're open to a sexual relationship ? Yeah . Yeah , I guess I am . Good . Yeah , yeah it is good . Did you want to start now ? Why don't we finish the section first . Oh . Okay . A little musical foreplay . Terrific . I'm good , I'm good to go . Me too .
