Hey . Sorry I'm late , but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus . You went with Thor ? What ? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God ? No , no , no , Raj has to be an Indian God . That's racism . I mean , look at Wolowitz he's not English , but he's dressed like Peter Pan . Sheldon is neither sound nor light , but he's obviously the Doppler Effect . I'm not Peter Pan , I'm Robin Hood . Really , because I saw Peter Pan , and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby . She was a little bigger than you , but it's basically the same look , man . Hey , Sheldon , there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party . I don't care if anybody gets it , I'm going as the Doppler Effect . No , it's not ... If I have to , I can demonstrate . Neeeeoooowwwww ! Terrific . Um , this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group , and I need you not to embarrass me tonight . Well , what exactly do you mean by embarrass you ? For example , tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey . Well , there's nothing embarrassing about that , your father worked with Lewis Leakey , a great anthropologist . It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting . All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group . A potential close friend and ... perhaps more . I don't want to look like a dork .
