What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents ? I play golf with her father , I won't be able to look at him . Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball , Papa . Oh , now you're a funny man ? This is not funny , Mr Funny Man . Doctor and Mrs . Koothrappali , in all fairness , it wasn't entirely Raj's fault . This is a family matter Sheldon . No , I'm Leonard . Oh , sorry , you all look alike to us . But he's right , Papa , listen to him . You ! You are the one who ruined everything ! Who is it ? We can't see . Turn us , turn us . Go ahead , tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren . How would I know , do you have a low sperm count ? This has nothing to do with my sperm count . You are wearing the boxers that we sent you , aren't you Rajesh . Yes Mommy . Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities . Can we please stop talking about my testicles ? Sheldon , tell them what you did . What did I do ? You left with his date . Friends don't do that to each other . Oh . Alright , noted . Sorry . Sorry ? That's all you can say is sorry ? Take it , Raj . It's more than I've ever gotten . And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring . Drunk ? And boring , her words . I knew it , he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic . I'm not an alcoholic . Then why were you drunk ? It was just this one time , Papa , I swear . Are you in denial ? Do we have to come over and do an intervention ? Don't embarrass him in front of his friends . Alright . Carry us outside , we want to talk to you in private . But Papa , please ... . Now , Rajesh . I have to go . Now listen to me ... . Please wait until I get into the hall . Okay , well , good night . Hold on . What happened with you and Lalita ? We ate . She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks , nothing I didn't already know , and I came home . So you're not going to see her again ? Why would I see her again ? I already have a dentist . I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren .
