Grab a napkin , homie . You just got served . It's fine . You win . What's his problem ? His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him . Been there . Hello . Sorry I'm late . But I was in the hallway , chatting up Penny . Really ? You ? Rajesh Koothrapali , spoke to Penny ? Actually , I was less the chatter than the chattee . What did she say ? Is she still mad at me ? Well , she was upset at first , but , probably because her sister shot somebody . Then there was something about you and ... then she hugged me . She hugged you ? How did she hug you ? Is that her perfume I smell ? intoxicating , isn't it ?
