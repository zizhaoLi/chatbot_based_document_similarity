I've been thinking about time travel again . Why , did you hit a roadblock with invisibility ? Put it on the back burner . Anyway , it occurs to me , if I ever did perfect a time machine , I'd just go into the past and give it to myself , thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place . Interesting . Yeah , it really takes the pressure off . Sounds like a breakthrough , should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover ? It's time travel , Leonard , I will have already done that . Then I guess congratulations are in order . No , congratulations will have been in order . You know , I'm not going to enjoy this party . I know , I'm familiar with you . At the last department party , Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes . Yes , I was there . You know what's interesting about caves , Leonard ? What ? Nothing . Well then we'll avoid Finkleday , we'll meet the new department head , congratulate him , shake his hand and go . How's this ? Pleased to meet you , Dr . Gablehouser . How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you , despite the fact that you've done no original research in 25 years , and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes , each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement . Mahalo . Mahalo's a nice touch . Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language . Interesting , you should lead with that .
