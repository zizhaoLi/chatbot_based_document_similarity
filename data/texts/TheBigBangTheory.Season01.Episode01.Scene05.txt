I really think we should examine the chain of causality here . Must we ? Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower . Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend . Query , on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events ? She asked me to do her a favour , Sheldon . Ah , yes , well that may be the proximal cause of our journey , but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause . Which is ? You think with your penis . That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come . Oh , right , yes , I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian , Arabic and Farsi . Why can't she get her own TV . Come on , you know how it is with break-ups . No , I don't . And neither do you . Wuh , I , I broke up with Joyce Kim . You did not break up with Joyce Kim , she defected to North Korea . To mend her broken heart . This situation is much less complicated . There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV . She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him . So we get to have a scene with him ? No , Sheldon , there's not going to be a scene . There's two of us and one of him . Leonard , the two of us can't even carry a TV .
