Is he here ? If he were , I wouldn't be . Do you know what he did . He watched me work for ten minutes , and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me . Is that even possible ? As it turns out , yes . Something's got to be done about him , Leonard . Like what ? He'll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is . Well , what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon ? Then our problem would be solved . Hang on , are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim ? I'm not saying no . We don't have to go that far , there are other means available . We can't send him back to North Korea . He knows how to get out . The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus . That won't happen , he's not interested in anything but physics . What about biology ? What ? You know , biology ? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind . Howard , he's fifteen . Yeah , so , when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8 . She was sleeping with you ? No , I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did . Oh , good , you're all here . Look , I've decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you're working on and join me , we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade , twelve years tops . Go away ? Hmm . Could it be me ?
