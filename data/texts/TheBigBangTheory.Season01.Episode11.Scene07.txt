Thanks for bringing me home . Oh , it's okay , I didn't really need to work today , it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything . Good . Good . Okay , well , you feel better . Wait , where are you going ? Um , home , to write some bad checks . You're going to leave me ? Sheldon , you are a grown man , haven't you ever been sick before ? Well , of course , but , not by myself . Really , never ? Well , once . When I was fifteen , and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany . Studying abroad ? No , visiting professor . Anyway , the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to , and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia . And there was no-one there to take care of you ? No . No , my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again . Again ? It was tornado season . And it was an aluminum house . Anyway , the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English , when I finally managed to convince her I was sick , she said " Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung? " What does that mean ? Based on what happened next , I assume it means " would you like an enema? " Okay , sweetie , I'll take care of you , what do you need ? Well , my mom used to give me sponge baths . Okay , ground rules , no sponge baths , and definitely no enemas . Agreed .
