There you go . You're right , this side does look better . No , no , I didn't say better , I said less stained . I just checked the house , there's probably twenty , twenty-five people in there . You're kidding . Is that all ? All ? In particle physics , twenty five is Woodstock . Oh , well , then good ! I wasn't expecting such a crowd , I'm a little nervous . It's okay , just open with a joke , you'll be fine . A joke . Okay . How about this , um , okay , uh there's this farmer , and he has these chickens , but they won't lay any eggs . So , he calls a physicist to help . The physicist then does some calculations , and he says , um , I have a solution , but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum . Right ? Oh , sorry , I've just , I've heard it before . Let's roll . Hey , nice suit . It's a classic , right ? I really should have brought my own car .
