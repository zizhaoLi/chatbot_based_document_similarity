Are you still mad about the sperm bank ? No . You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs ? Not really . If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres , most people will trip . I don't care . Two millimetres ? That doesn't seem right . No , it's true , I did a series of experiments when I was twelve , my father broke his clavicle . Is that why they sent you to boarding school ? No , that was the result of my work with lasers . New neighbor ? Evidently . Significant improvement over the old neighbor . Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition , yes she is . Oh , hi ! Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi ? We don't mean to interrupt , we live across the hall . Oh , that's nice . Oh ... uh ... no ... we don't live together ... um ... we live together but in separate , heterosexual bedrooms . Oh , okay , well , guess I'm your new neighbor , Penny . Leonard , Sheldon . Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Well , uh , oh , welcome to the building . Thank you , maybe we can have coffee sometime . Oh , great . Great . Great . Great . Well , bye . Bye . Bye . Bye . Should we have invited her for lunch ? No . We're going to start Season Two of " Battlestar Galactica " . We already watched the Season Two DVDs . Not with commentary . I think we should be good neighbors , invite her over , make her feel welcome . We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over . Well , then that was wrong of us . We need to widen our circle . I have a very wide circle . I have 212 friends on myspace . Yes , and you've never met one of them . That's the beauty of it . I'm going to invite her over . We'll have a nice meal and chat . Chat ? We don't chat . At least not offline . Well it's not difficult , you just listen to what she says , and then you say something appropriate in response . To what end ? Hi . Again . Hi . Hi . Hi . Hi . Anyway , um . We brought home Indian food . And , um . I know that moving can be stressful , and I find that when I'm undergoing stress , that good food and company can have a comforting effect . Also , curry is a natural laxative , and I don't have to tell you that , uh , a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about . Leonard , I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation , you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements . Oh , you're inviting me over to eat ? Uh , yes . Oh , that's so nice , I'd love to . Great . So , what do you guys do for fun around here ? Well , today we tried masturbating for money .
