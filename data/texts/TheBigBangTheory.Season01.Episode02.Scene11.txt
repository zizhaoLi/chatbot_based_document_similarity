Six two inch dowels . Check . One package , Phillips head screws . Check . Guys , seriously , I grew up on a farm , okay , I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve , I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media center . No , please , we insist , it's the least we can do considering . Considering what ? How great this place looks ? align= " left " | Oh boy , I was afraid of this . What ? These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components . This right here is why Sweden has no space program . Well , uh , it looked pretty good in the store . It is an inefficient design , for example Penny has a flat screen TV , which means all the space behind it is wasted . We could put her stereo back there . And control it how ? Run an infra-red repeater , photocell here , emitter here , easy peasy . align= " left " | Good point , how you gonna cool it ? Hey guys , I got this . Hang on Penny . How about fans , here and here ? Also inefficient , and might be loud . How about liquid coolant ? Maybe a little aquarium pump here , run some quarter inch PVC ... Guys , this is actually really simple . Hold on , honey , men at work . The PVC comes down here , maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here . Oh , really , show me where we put a drip tray , a sluice and an overflow reservoir ? And if water is involved we're going to have to ground the crap out of the thing . Guys , it's hot in here , I think I'll just take off all my clothes . Oh , I've got it . How about if we replace panels A , B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminum . Right , then the entire thing's one big heat sink . Perfect , Leonard , why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminum , Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch . Meet back here in an hour ? Done . Got it . Okay , this place does look pretty good .
