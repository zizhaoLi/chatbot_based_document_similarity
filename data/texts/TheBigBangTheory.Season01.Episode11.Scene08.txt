Here we go , ten and a half hours of apey goodness . Oh dammit , my glasses . Okay , I'm blind here guys , can you help me find them ? Sorry . Found 'em . Oh great . Sorry , don't you have a spare . Yeah , at home . Well if you leave now , you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston . Unless Sheldon's there , in which case you'll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web . Hi , Penny . I was wondering , is Sheldon still at the restaurant ? Okay , that was very nice of you . Okay , gotta go , got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here , gotta go , bye . He's home , I'm screwed . Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness . How about Lasic ? You want me to get eye surgery ? Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon , or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam ? Well ? I'm thinking !
