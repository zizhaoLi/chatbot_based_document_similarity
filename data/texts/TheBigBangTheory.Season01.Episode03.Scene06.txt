Oh , good lord . You don't know me , you don't wear my chains ... God , that's a good song . If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide . ) Oh , I hope that scratching post is for you . I know what you're thinking , I've taken your asthma into account . There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos . Leonard , listen to me ... I've been thinking about names , I'm kind of torn between Einstein , Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots . Leonard , do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat ? Maybe , if it's a cute little cuddly cat . Oh , come on , Leonard ! This is obviously about Penny . It doesn't matter . The woman's not interested in me , the woman rejected me . Okay , look , I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker . Nevertheless , I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you . You did not ask her out . You're right . I didn't ask her out , I should ask her out . No . No , now that was not my point . My point was , don't buy a cat . No , but you're right . I should march over there and ask her out . Oh , goody , we're getting a cat .
