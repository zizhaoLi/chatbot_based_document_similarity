So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed , it will not go through both slits . If it's unobserved it will , however , if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target , it will not have gone through both slits . Agreed , what's your point ? There's no point , I just think it's a good idea for a tee-shirt . Excuse me ? Hang on . One across is Aegean , eight down is Nabakov , twenty-six across is MCM , fourteen down is ... move your finger ... phylum , which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince . See , Papa Doc's capital idea , that's Port-au-Prince . Haiti . Can I help you ? Yes . Um , is this the High IQ sperm bank ? If you have to ask , maybe you shouldn't be here . I think this is the place . Fill these out . Thank-you . We'll be right back . Oh , take your time . I'll just finish my crossword puzzle . Oh , wait . Leonard , I don't think I can do this . What , are you kidding ? You're a semi-pro . No . We are committing genetic fraud . There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring , think about that . I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers . Sheldon , this was your idea . A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment . I know , and I do yearn for faster downloads , but there's some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm , what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve . I'm sure she'll still love him . I wouldn't . Well , what do you want to do ? I want to leave . Okay . What's the protocol for leaving ? I don't know , I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before . Let's try just walking out . Okay . Bye . Bye-bye See you .
