How come you didn't go into work today . I'm taking a sabbatical , because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds . So you got canned , huh ? Theoretical physicists do not get canned . But yeah . Well , maybe it's all for the best , you know I always say , when one door closes , another one opens . No it doesn't . Not unless the two doors are connected by relays , or there are motion sensors involved . No , no , I meant ... Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door . Never mind . Slow down . Slow down , please slow down . We're fine . Look , you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars . Oh , sure I am . No , no . Let me do the math for you , this car weighs let's say 4,000lb , now add say 140 for me , 120 for you . 120 ? Oh , I'm sorry , did I insult you ? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth ? Well , yeah . Interesting . Anyway , that gives us a total weight of , let's say , 4,400lb . Let's say 4,390 . Fine . We're travelling forward at , good Lord , 51 miles an hour . Now let's assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned , still , by the time we come to a stop , we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us , an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death , mutilation and ... oh look , they built a new put-put course .
