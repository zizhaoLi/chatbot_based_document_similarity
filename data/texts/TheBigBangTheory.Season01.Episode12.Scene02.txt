So , Dennis , how long have you been in America . A year and a half . No kidding , you speak English really well . So do you . Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions . What are you talking about ? That . He's not wrong . Alright , and this is my office . Is this part of the tour ? Nope . Goodbye . Come on , Sheldon , we've hardly shown him anything . Oh , alright , this is my desk , these are my books , this is my door , please close it behind you . Goodbye . Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections . Keen observation , goodbye . You see where you went wrong , don't you ? Leonard . Huh , yeah ? Get him out . Come on , Dennis , I'll show you the rec center , they've got nautilus equipment . Do I look like I lift weights . Not heavy ones . It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach . You think I haven't considered it ? You really think I haven't considered it ? Have you considered it ? Get him out Leonard . Come on , Dennis , I'll show you the radiation lab . Wow , you won the Stephenson award . Yes , in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it . Really , how old ? Fourteen and a half . You were the youngest person ever to win it . It's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror , isn't it ? Mmm ,
