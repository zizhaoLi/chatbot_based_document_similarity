Unbelievable . Components I built are on the International Space Station , and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park . I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman " you have to frisk me , I have a rocket in my pants . " Hey , look at that . It's Dennis Kim . Wow , I almost didn't recognize him . You know , I kind of feel bad about what we did to him . Yeah , we really ruined his life . Screw him , he was weak .
