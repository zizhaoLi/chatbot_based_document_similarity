You know , I think I may have misjudged this restaurant . No kidding . I won't go out on a limb , but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger . Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted . Way ahead of you . I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays , and just dropping Soup Plantation . Really ? Yeah , the name always confused me anyway , Soup Plantation . You can't grow soup . So , how's everything . Terrific , you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future . Really , oh yay ! Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table ? Um , I don't know , a psychiatrist ? So hey , how are things with you and Lesley ? Oh , to be honest , I don't think it's going to work out . Oh , oh that's too bad . Well hey , don't worry , I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you . . Well what did she mean by that ? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention ? You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy ? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker . This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio . Are you even listening to me ? Of course I'm listening . Blah blah , hopeless Penny delusion , blah blah blah . Okay then . You know , you can grow the ingredients for soup . .
