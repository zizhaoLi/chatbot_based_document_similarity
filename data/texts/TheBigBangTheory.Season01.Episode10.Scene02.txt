Leonard , Leonard , Leonard ... What ? I need to speak to you . It's two o'clock in the morning It's important . I highly doubt that . Go away . . Are you still out there ? Yes . What ? You're right , it can wait until morning . What , what , what , what , what ? Never mind . I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle , you're in no state to talk . Sheldon , what is it ? I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny . What was I supposed to say . You could have told her the truth . That would have hurt her feelings . Is that a relevant factor ? Yes . Then I suppose you could have agreed to go . And what would I have said afterwards ? I would suggest something to the effect of , singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you , and if you disagree , I'd recommend you have a CAT scan , to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing center of your brain . I couldn't say that , I would have to say , you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again . Why ? It's the social protocol , it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at . I was not aware of that . Well now you are . Oh , alright . Leonard . Yes . When we played chess earlier , you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again . Goodnight .
